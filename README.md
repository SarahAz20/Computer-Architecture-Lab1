1. Create a 4-to-1 multiplexer using ONLY tri-state buffers and inverters in LogicWorks. 
Multiplexing is a generic term used to describe the operation of sending one or more digital 
signals over a common transmission line at different times and as such, the device we use 
to do just that is called  a Multiplexer (hereafter,  MUX). A 4-to-1 MUX consists of four 
data input lines as D0 to D3, two select lines as S0 and S1 and a single output line Y. It is a 
combinational logic circuit designed to switch one of four input lines through to a single 
common  output  line  by  the  application  of  two  select  signals  (i.e.,  S0  and  S1).  
In  other  words, the select lines S0 and S1 together select one of the four input lines to connect it to 
the output line. Please read textbook page 140 section 3-7 Multiplexers before 
implementing this lab assignment.
